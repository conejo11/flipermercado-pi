# Flipermercado Front-End

### Requirements
The project is designed to be run on a [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/), so, we decided to use as less packages as possible while being as cross plataform as possible.

  - [Python 3.6+](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-360/)
  - [PyQt 4](https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/download)
  - Any X server running
  - Our [API server](https://github.com/izn/flipermercado-api) running (or your own)

### Installation

  - Clone the repo
  - Run ```$ python index.py```

### TODOs

 - Write RFID module
 - Tests
 - Keep resources as low as possible
